                        As E-Ration is a web portal which means it has to be faster and more convenient for every user while they are interacting with it.
                        The E-Ration is made up of many modules such as admin module, user module. We can split the 
                        modules and with the help of this model, we can work and split the modules differently using this model.
                        In an incremental model, the feedback of the client or the changes given by the client can be implemented in the next level.
                        Implementing the changes will not create problems in the incremental model.
                        The concept of E-Ration includes frequent changes in the inputs.
                        That's why we had chosen the incremental model for the E-ration.
